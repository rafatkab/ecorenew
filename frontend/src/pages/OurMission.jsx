We aim to inspire and engage young people by providing meaningful opportunities for them to explore, appreciate, and actively participate in preserving the natural beauty of their community. Our two-week course unites York University students, experienced faculty, and community partners—Bruce’s Mill and TRCA—for collaborative, hands-on learning focused on renewing and revitalizing the outdoors. </div>
